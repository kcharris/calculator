# calculator
currently have all the inputs coming in through 1 string. This causes a problem with current dec locations. I can have one in one number but not more than one in the entire string. I could store data in an array or break the operators apart and do one thing at a time.
checkDec function needs to split string into array divided by operators and test last string of numbers.
